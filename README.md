I choose this topic because I am interested in the application of software to public health policy.

It is currently a work-in-progress. My original approach was to simply identify via RandomForest the features that correlate most strongly with treatment-seeking behavior. 

After further exploration with some feature engineering such as apriori and market basket analysis, I narrowed in on K-Means as my preferred solution to find naturally occurring clusters. 

Lastly, I plan on using t-SNE as my key data visualization.
